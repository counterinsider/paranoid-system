### TODO list

1. Analyze and audit cargo dependecies;
1. Leverage `tokio` tracing capability;
1. Decide integration of TSA-based functionality for client enrollment verification;
1. Consider upgrade to `picky-asn1-x509` version `0.14.5`;
1. EK certificate verification, server AK certificate;
1. Sealing under TPM compound policy `policyor`;
1. Linux IMA subsystem auto-configuration (kernel config check and kernel parameters setup);
1. Linux IMA policy `/etc/ima/ima-policy` assertion: ensure program config file is located on partition for which IMA measurement is set up;
1. Stored on disk TPM (UEFI) log encryption with TPM make/activate credential functionality;
1. Store boot counter and policy value on TPM persistent handle instead storing on disk. Additionally, encrypt the values with TPM make/activate credential;
1. Detailed description of local attestation failure;
1. Detailed description of remote attestation failure;
1. Desktop/console user notifications of attestation failure, boot counter mismatch;
1. Assess necessity to keep policy digests;
1. Payload encryption with user-provided symmetric key or with TPM make/activate credential;
1. Add server database backends: PostgreSQL, MySQL, not only SQLite.
1. Server requests rate limitiing;
1. Server privilege drop after binding to lower port.
1. Multiplex server log stream to database (if enabled).
1. Include server name in TOTP generator name.
1. Add server response errors in server log.
1. Filter out log messages from `tss_esapi` crate (and library)
